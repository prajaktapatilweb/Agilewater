                            Framework by which concepts of Scrum could quickly be implemented
                            within multiple teams consisting of hundreds or even thousands of
                            scrum practitioners. Previously Scrum was used for a small group
                            of teams, but with the evolution of Scrum@Scale, it became
                            possible to implement the concept of Scrum to thousands of
                            multiple teams within an organisation.

                    At Scale simply means multiple scrum teams working on a common goal.
                    Scrum at scale is an optimised and functional framework which aims at
                    attaining highest value with sustainable efficiency within
                    multiple-valued team coordination. The framework of Scrum@Scale helps
                    to address and react to complex problems very quickly and makes the
                    team coordination linear and gives an agile development method.

                    <br></br>Scrum at scale is lightweight which means it gives the
                    minimum viable bureaucracy. Being lightweight it is also easy to
                    understand and only involves the Scrum team. But when it comes to
                    mastering, it becomes a little tough as it requires implementing a new
                    operating model to govern the work and process flow.

                <span>
                    To scale Scrum with multiple teams, Jeff Sutherland, the man who
                    proposed the theory of Scrum says that one can create many teams with
                    optimal size to implement the Scrum operations. The teams comprise a
                    Scrum of Scrums with a representative who leads that very Scrum team.
                    These representatives are often called Scrum Masters as they
                    coordinate the work and process flow to hold an efficient Scaled daily
                    Scrum (SDS).

                    The team at Scrum share a common pattern and visualise the framework
                    collectively. While scaling Scrum with various teams, it is needed to
                    address the backlogs rapidly and make the planning be collaborative
                    across all the team. This not only widens the approach but also makes
                    the team coordination much more effective.

            para: (
                <span>
                    Scaling the various operations in the Scrum framework must and should
                    be done on various parameters. To Scale the operations mean to analyze
                    the process and productive workflow thoroughly to give the expected
                    and delivered product same.

                    <b>(1) Battling the Complexity:</b>
                    <br></br>
                    Developing the measures so as to resolve the complexity and gain an
                    agile development method is not as easy as it sounds. And so there is
                    complexity in various operations done to maintain a structured Scrum
                    framework model. The Scale gives the analyzed data of how
                    appropriately and efficiently the members of Scrum are working.

                    <b>(2) Regulation of Production and Service gateways:</b>
                    <br></br>
                    The production and service are two pillars of an organization on
                    grounds of which various operations are performed. And so they need to
                    be configured with optimized techniques. Scaling the operations gives
                    the overview of how to use these techniques to regulate the production
                    and monitor the service which is provided.

                    <b>(3) Overviewing the entire process:</b>
                    <br></br>
                    Overviewing the process gives an outflow of the section to improve and
                    the section which are doing good. It helps to estimate what exactly is
                    getting short or what more could be done to outreach focused and
                    productive results. Scaling the operation gives the data and an
                    analyzed answer of what and how to focus on to get an improved result
                    and satisfactory growth.

                    Both provide solutions for multi-team implementation for Scrum. Whereas Scrum@Scale implements a purisitic version of Scrum@Scale. Mainly it works on iterative and incremental delivery each sprint and does not prescrobe for any standard organisational structure. SAFe gives us a prescribed organisation structure and supports delivery of working software after 5 iterations

                    <br></br><br></br>SAFe prescribes a sequential set of events practices, and stakeholder relativity with hierarchical roles whereas Scrum@Scale suggests the evolution of Structure based on scrum values and minimal viable bureaucracy.

                    <br></br><br></br>SAFe structure across multiple organisations would be the same but Scrum@Scale structure may be different. Scrum@Scale is slowly getting popular. Even pioneer SAFe implementers like John Deer are now moving to <Link href="">Scrum@Scale.</Link>
