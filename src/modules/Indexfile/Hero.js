            Raise Agility Towards Innovation & Achievement..

                1to1Guru envisions preparing and motivating our students for a
                rapidly changing and ever-evolving world by nurturing
                students&apos; critical thinking skills, communication, and
                perseverance. We understand the importance of personalised
                learning for student&apos;s overall growth and are fully committed
                to students&apos; career readiness by empowering them to meet
                current and future challenges.

                The ratio of the number of students to teachers is often used to
                adjudge the quality of the teaching-learning process. Research
                indicates that the smaller this ratio, the better is the learning.
                But even in the best institutions, there are crowded classrooms in
                which one teacher is teaching several dozen students, sometimes
                even hundreds of students! How can any teacher, however good,
                provide personalised attention to each student in such a large
                class? To overcome this, with the support of state-of-art
                technology, we have designed an individual digital classroom for
                each student: One Guru One Shishya (One Mentor One student)

                In our classroom, the ratio of teachers to students is 1-to-1;
                hence we maximise the student and mentor interaction and in a true
                sense there is a real personalised learning experience. Our
                dedicated mentors are subject matter experts who use proven
                teaching strategies, supported by state-of-art technology, to help
                the students bring out the best in them.
