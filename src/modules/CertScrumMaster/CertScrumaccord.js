                    Scrum is an optimised and functional framework which aims at attaining
                    highest value with sustainable efficiency within multiple-valued team
                    coordination. The framework of Scrum helps to address and react to
                    complex problems very quickly and makes the team coordination linear
                    and give an agile development method.

                    Scrum needs an analysed and evaluated approach with every process
                    involved in the work process. And that needs an appropriate emphasis
                    on the principles of Scrum which is must if one wants to get efficient
                    performance, quality results and valuable solutions. However
                    ScrumGuide does not refer to any principles, it is based on following
                    key aspects.
