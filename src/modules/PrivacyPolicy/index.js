                Correction, deletion, or export of personal data<br></br>

We will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we gather about you if you make a request. You also have the right to revoke your permission to the gathering of personal data by submitting a written request for data erasure, which the Company will honour in accordance with current privacy regulations.

                <Typography variant='h3' sx={{ my: 3 }}>If you have joined AgileWaters on your own</Typography>
                You can access, edit, or export your Personal Information in your online AgileWaters account at any time by logging in and heading to your profile page, or by contacting us. If you're using an account given by a company (AgileWaters Authorised Training Partner or your Employer) Exceptions to Deletion: If you request access to your personal information and discover that it is incorrect, we will work with you to amend or delete it as soon as possible – unless we need to maintain it for legitimate business or legal reasons. We endeavour to keep our services up to date in a way that prevents data loss due to human error or criminal intent. As a result, we may not be able to delete residual copies of your information from our active servers or backup systems immediately after you delete it from our services. Data Portability Exception: There may be practical restrictions to the quantity of information we can share. We may, for example, limit an individual's access to personal information if the burden or expense of giving access is disproportionate to the dangers to the individual's privacy or if doing so would infringe the rights of others. Except in the case of data correction, we may save and store earlier versions of your Personal Information in our databases, access logs, and other records in order to comply with various routine data audits.
